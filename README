XISS (pronounced KISS) is a simple xml parsing/building library for Java. The goal is to provide a very simple
and very terse API for building XML documents in Java code.

An Example:
XML.Doc doc = XML.doc();
doc.comment("This is the structure for a person");
XML.E person = doc.root("person");
{
  person.e("first-name", "Bob");
  person.e("last-name").setText("Jones");
  person.comment("This is the structure for addresses");
  XML.E addresses = person.e("addresses");
  {
    XML.E homeAddress = addresses.e("address").set("location", "Home");
    {
      homeAddress.e("address", "100 Main St");
      homeAddress.e("city", "Richmond");
      homeAddress.e("state", "VA");
      homeAddress.e("zip", "23233");
    }
    addresses.cdata("This is a cdata section! <test> of cdata!");
  }
}

Oh, and printing a DOM object just pretty-prints XML:

System.out.println(doc);

Produces:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!-- This is the structure for a person -->
<person>
  <first-name>Bob</first-name>
  <last-name>Jones</last-name>
  <!-- This is the structure for addresses -->
  <addresses>
    <address location="Home">
      <address>100 Main St</address>
      <city>Richmond</city>
      <state>VA</state>
      <zip>23233</zip>
    </address>
    <![CDATA[This is a cdata section! <test> of cdata!]]>
  </addresses>
</person>
